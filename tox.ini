# tox (https://tox.readthedocs.io/) is a tool for running tests
# in multiple virtualenvs. This configuration file will run the
# test suite on all supported python versions. To use it, "pip install tox"
# and then run "tox" from this directory.


# Python 3.6 was the version deployed on Ubuntu 18.04
# Python 3.8 is the version deployed on Ubuntu 20.04 servers such as triscotte
# Python 3.10 is the version deployed on the Ubuntu 22.04 master
# Python 3.12 is the version deployed on the Ubuntu 24.04 master

# Passing multiple commands as part of install_command does not seem to work,
# neither does substitution of {opts} and {packages}, so I had to resort to an
# ugly hack using sh -c... (YL 2025-03-05 using tox 4.24.1)
